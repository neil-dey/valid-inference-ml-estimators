This repository contains the source code for the simulations and experiments in our paper "Valid Inference for Machine Learning Model Parameters."

Code was run using:
    - Python v3.8.10
    - Numpy v1.23.3
    - Scipy v1.9.1
    - Tensorflow v2.9.1

The file workflow.sh contains the code necessary to replicate all simulations and experiments in the order presented in the paper.
